# Premium Headphone Product Card

This is one of the first projects I built while learning HTML & CSS.  
I wanted to create a clean and simple product card — something that looks real and helps me practice basic UI structure.

The card includes:
- Product image  
- Title and price  
- Short description  
- Feature list  
- A “Buy Now” button  

It's nothing advanced, but it helped me understand how layout, spacing, and text styling work together.  
I’ll keep improving this project as I learn more about CSS and design.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  

### Purpose
I’m sharing this project to track my progress as a beginner developer.  
It’s the starting point of my front-end journey, and I’ll build better things from here.
